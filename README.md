# Surfs Up
## Overview

An analysis was conducted to determine if weather patterns in Oahu support the opening of a combined surf and ice cream shop.  The first step was to collect weather and precipitation data from measurement stations in the State of Hawaii for the time period of January 1, 2010 to August 23, 2017.  Weather data from the months of June and December were then reviewed to determine if weather patterns from different types of the year were consistent and favorable to sustain a successful surf and ice cream shop.

## Locations of Weather Stations

The data collected originated from nine weather stations in Hawaii, mostly on the Island of Oahu.  The following table sorts these stations by the frequency of observations made during the time period.
